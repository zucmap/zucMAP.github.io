        <h1>Why should I come?</h1>
        <p>Talks are an important piece of your academical education. If you need some motivation on why you should
          pass by, on his homepage, Prof.
          <i>Ravi Vakil</i> shares some very interesting points $\hookrightarrow$ <a href="http://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html">here</a>.

          <!--the following points on talks that we rudely copy
          and paste here below:
        <ul>
        <li>Older graduate students will verify that there is a high correlation between those students who are doing
          the broadest and deepest work and those who are regularly attending seminars. Many people erroneously
          conclude that those who are the strongest students therefore go to seminars, while in fact the causation
          goes very much in the opposite direction.</li>
        <li>Go to research seminars earlier than you think you should. Do not just go to seminars that you think are
          directly related to what you do (or more precisely, what you currently think you currently do). You should
          certainly go to every single seminar related to algebraic geometry [he talks to potential PhD candidates
          and he's an algebraic geometer, so you should read *the field you like most*] that you can, and
          likely drop by
          other
          seminars occasionally too. Learning to get information out of research seminars is an acquired skill,
          usually acquired much later than the skill of reading mathematics. You may think it isn't helpful to go to
          a seminar where you understand just 5% of what the speaker says, and may want to wait until you are closer
          to 100%; but no one is anywhere near 100% (even the speaker!), so you should go anyway.</li>
        <li>Try to follow the thread of the talk, and when you get thrown, try to get back on again. (This isn't
          always possible, and admittedly often the fault lies with the speaker.)</li>
        <li>At the end of the talk, you should try to answer the questions: What question(s) is the speaker trying to
          answer? Why should we care about them? What flavor of results has the speaker proved? Do I have a small
          example of the phenonenon under discussion? You can even scribble down these questions at the start of the
          talk, and jot down answers to them during the talk.</li>
        <li>Try to extract three words from the talk (no matter how tangentially related to the subject at hand) that
          you want to know the definition of. Then after the talk, ask me what they mean. (In general, feel free to
          touch base with me after every seminar. I might tell you something interesting related to the talk.)</li>
        <li>Try the <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/threethings.html">three things exercise</a>.</li>
        <li>See if you can get one lesson from the talk (broadly interpreted). If you manage to get one lesson from
          each talk you go to, you'll learn a huge amount over time, although you'll only realize this after quite a
          while. (If you are unable to learn even one thing about mathematics from a talk, think about what the
          speaker could have done differently so that you could have learned something. You can learn a lot about
          giving good talks by thinking about what makes bad talks bad.)
        </li>
        <li>Try to ask one question at as many seminars as possible, either during the talk, or privately afterwards.
          The act of trying to formulating an interesting question (for you, not the speaker!) is a worthwhile
          exercise, and can focus the mind.
        </li>
        <li>Here's a phenomenon I was surprised to find: you'll go to talks, and hear various words, whose
          definitions you're not so sure about. At some point you'll be able to make a sentence using those words;
          you won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the sentence is correct. You'll also be able to ask a
          question using those words. You still won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the question is
          interesting, and you'll want to know the answer. Then later on, you'll learn what the words mean more
          precisely, and your sense of how they fit together will make that learning much easier. The reason for this
          phenomenon is that mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically,
          and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll never get anywhere. Instead,
          you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from
          these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning "forwards". (Caution:
          this backfilling is necessary. There can be a temptation to learn lots of fancy words and to use them in
          fancy sentences without being able to say precisely what you mean. You should feel free to do that, but you
          should always feel a pang of guilt when you do.)
        </li>
        <li>Your thesis problem may well come out of an idea you have while sitting in a seminar.</li>
        <li>Go to colloquia fairly often, so you have a reasonable idea of what is happening in other parts of
          mathematics. It is amazing what can become relevant to your research. You won't believe it until it happens
          to you. And it won't happen to you unless you go to colloquia. Ditto for seminars in other fields.</li>
      </ul>
